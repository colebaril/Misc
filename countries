# Do the above for all countries, and then simply use rbind on all the dfs. 
# Normally, I would read in all excel files together. However, they are not all the same, so the data should be visually inspected on a case by case basis before being read in.

# Consider the following:

# To create new df
df <- rbind(df1, df2, df3)

# To save the file
write.csv(rbind(df1, df2, df3), "filename.csv")

# Depending on what the data looks like, we can create scripts to generate graphics using whatever combo of variables (e.g., by session, site, country).
